<h1>Asqare</h1>
version 1.3, by <i><a href="http://www.alfray.com">Ralf</a></i>, November 2008.
<br/>
Visit the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/asqare/">asqare project page</a>.
<p/>
Summary: <i>Asqare</i> is a simple stone-swapping game for
<a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a>.
Two different gameplays are provided:
<a href="#bijoux">Bijoux</a> and <a href="#bouchebee">Bouche B&eacute;e</a>.

<a name="bijoux"><h1>Bijoux</h1></a>
In this gameplay, the screen is covered with colored sprites (squares or circles).
When you align 3 or more in a row, all adjacent sprites of the same
shape &amp; color vanish.
<p/>

You can only swap adjacent sprites vertically or horizontally.
You can swap sprites even if it won't result in a 3-or-more alignment,
but that will cost you 10% of your current score.

<p/>
The game never finishes and there are no levels.


<a name="bouchebee"><h1>Bouche B&eacute;e</h1></a>
In this gameplay, the screen is covered with colored circles.

When a circle is selected, all the adjacent circles of the same color blink,
as they are selected too. When this selected area is selected again, all the
circles collapse and vanish. The area must contain at least two circles
for it to go away.
<p/>

This game has no levels either. However you can quickly get in a situation
where it is not possible to find areas with 2 or more circles of the same
color, in which case the game is finished.
<p/>

(Note: there's no indication the game is finished yet... this will come soon.)
